Tonight I set up the initial repo for Deep Space 23 in git and populated it with a basic rust workspace. The goal for this project is to create a simple engine powered by miniquad and use it to make a simple space station management game.

The first steps will be to get some basic sprites drawing to the screen, asset management to load some images, and then a simple scene graph. My initial impression would be to model the engine along the lines of corona sdk, something simple and relatively unopinionated. But we will see how it all goes!
